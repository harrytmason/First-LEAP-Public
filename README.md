# First-LEAP-Public
A public version of the code used in the First LEAP project. Specifically, the code I developed working on processing infant ECG signals.

This folder does not contain the full version-controlled code, but a subsection of scripts that are currently the most relevant to anyone trying to view the project or who want a demonstration of my coding.

The following papers are relevant to this code:

1. The first paper to refence my methods. The focus on the paper is the device we developed for the project (which I did some data quality control for as well).

2. The first paper focussed purely on the ECG processing. This is the main paper to read in order to understand the methodology and the motivation behind certain parameter choices.
